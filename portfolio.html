         My name is Dunni Famakinwa.I am 13yrs old,I live in lagos,Nigeria.My dream is to be a web developer,computer<br> programmer and one of the Top 10 Women in Technology.This wasn't always my<br> dream.I wanted to be a chartered accountant like parents,I didn't have a dream of my own just to follow the family <br>chain.Until my caregiver told me to break the family chain and since birth I had a love of technology and<br> computer,if my parents needed anything with phone,laptop,technology.I can always fix it and now here i am<br> following my dreams.I know i wont be able to achieve much because i am still very young but surronded by<br> technology and the determination to be someone great in life i have expanded my knowledge e.g - I know how to<br> code in html and css.I work at Infinions Technologies as an intern and i have learnt a great number of stuffs.To<br> code is really exciting, and to my fellow mates what is coding without practice?.When you don't get it continue trying and trying and you will smile at your success!!!!.
